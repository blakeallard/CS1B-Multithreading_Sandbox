This program manages and displays information for a set of students. It allows users to input details like the student's name, ID, and grade, and then displays the entered information. The program utilizes classes and functions to encapsulate the student data and interactions, demonstrating basic Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Key Features:
Student Class: The program defines a Student class to store information for each student (name, ID, grade).

Input & Output: The user is prompted to input details for multiple students, and the program outputs the student information in a structured format.

Vector of Objects: A vector is used to store multiple Student objects, demonstrating how to work with dynamic arrays in C++.

Encapsulation: The Student class provides methods to get, return, and display student information, encapsulating the logic of managing student data.

Skills Demonstrated:
Object-Oriented Programming: The program uses classes to store and manage student data, encapsulating behavior within the Student class.

Input/Output: The program prompts the user to input information and displays it in a readable format.

Vector Usage: A vector is used to manage the collection of students dynamically, highlighting the flexibility of vectors over fixed-size arrays.

Encapsulation and Method Usage: Methods are used to retrieve and display student data, showcasing the importance of separation between data storage and functionality.

Files Included:
main.cpp – The main file where the program runs, collects student data, and displays the information.

Student.h – Header file defining the Student class, its attributes, and member functions.

Student.cpp – Implements the methods of the Student class, including data retrieval and display functions.
